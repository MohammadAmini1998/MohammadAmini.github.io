👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at Iran University of Science And Technology.

🔬 My research interests are in Deep Learning and Reinfocement Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

🎸 I'm also passionate about shredding electric guitars.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Thesis works and Seminar
I have research experience on Reinforcement Learning [Github page](https://github.com/MohammadAmini1998/B.S.C-Thesis). This is a comprassion between some of most famous Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Additionally, I have research experience in Safe Reinforcement Learning, as showcased on my [Github page](https). In this research, I talk about the basics of Safe Reinforcement Learning and some of its most common algorithms like Shielding.
## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Outlier Detection through Null Space Analysis of Neural Networks paper and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a full guide to the **Github** page communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at this project [Github page](https://github.com/MohammadAmini1998/Advanced-Data-Mining-Project).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Research Assistant** at  Iran University Of Science And Technology ranked **4** among Iran universities in Iran under the supervision of Dr. Shahrokh Farahmand on **Multi Agent-Reinforcement Learning**.
Additionally, I have experience working as an **Research Assistant** at the AmirKabir University Of Technology ranked **3** among Iran universities under supervision of Prof. Mohmmad Bagher Menhaj. There I worked on Reinforcement Learning In Atari Games.
