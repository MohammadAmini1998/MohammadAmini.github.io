👨🏻‍💻 I have a master of science in Telecommunication systems from Iran university of science and technology and a bachelor of electrical engineering from Amir-Kabir university of technology. 

🔬 My research interests are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and their applications in Communication Systems like Vehicular Networks.

📚 I am currently working on a new paper focused on Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms designed to address bandwidth limitations in MARL environments and demonstrate their practical applications in real-world scenarios, such as vehicular networks
🎸 I'm also passionate about shredding electric guitars.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Thesis works
I have research experience on Reinforcement Learning for my bachelor's thesis. [Github page](https://github.com/MohammadAmini1998/B.S.C-Thesis). This is a comprassion between some of the most famous Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Additionally, I have doing research in Vehicular Networks, as showcased on my [Github page](https://github.com/MohammadAmini1998/Vehicular-Network). In this research, we are using a new Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning 
## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Outlier Detection through Null Space Analysis of Neural Networks paper and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a full guide to the **Github** page communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at this project [Github page](https://github.com/MohammadAmini1998/Advanced-Data-Mining-Project).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Research Assistant** at  Iran University Of Science And Technology ranked **4** among Iran universities in Iran under the supervision of Dr. Shahrokh Farahmand on **Multi Agent-Reinforcement Learning**.
Additionally, I have experience working as an **Research Assistant** at the AmirKabir University Of Technology ranked **3** among Iran universities under supervision of Prof. Mohmmad Bagher Menhaj. There I worked on Reinforcement Learning In Atari Games.
