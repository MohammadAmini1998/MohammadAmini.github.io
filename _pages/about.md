👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the Iran University Of Science And Technology.

🔬 My research interests are in Deep Learning and Reinfocement Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

🎸 Just like how I'm passionate about shredding electric guitars.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Research Assistant** at the Iran University Of Science And Technology in Iran under the supervision of Dr. Shahrokh Farahmand on **Multi Agent-Reinforcement Learning**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Research Assistant** at the AmirKabir University Of Technology. \
There I worked on Reinforcement Learning In Atari Games.
