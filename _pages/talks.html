<p style="text-decoration:underline;">My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I am passionate about exploring the application of reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques in solving complex problems in computer vision. I am particularly interested in developing novel algorithms that can learn from large-scale visual data to understand, analyze, and interpret the visual world. Additionally, I am intrigued by the challenges posed by data mining in extracting valuable insights and patterns from large datasets, and I am eager to explore how these techniques can be integrated with deep learning models to create more robust and efficient systems.</p>
