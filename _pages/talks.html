<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I am passionate about exploring the application of reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques in solving complex problems. I am particularly interested in developing novel algorithms that can learn from large-scale visual data to understand, analyze, and interpret the visual world. Additionally, I am intrigued by the challenges posed by data mining in extracting valuable insights and patterns from large datasets, and I am eager to explore how these techniques can be integrated with deep learning models to create more robust and efficient systems. In brief, I love coding and exploring novel ideas in Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Data Mining</p>
